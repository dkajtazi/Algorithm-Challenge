# Task 2 - Algorithms

The challenge of this task is to understand and analyze a given algorithm. In the second step, you should debug an issue in the algorithm (documented in a test case) and, if possible, fix it.

You can execute the test cases in your favourite IDE or via terminal using `node sample1.js` and `node sample2.js`.

## Tasks
1) Describe, what the algorithm given in `algorithm.js` does 
2) In test case sample2.js an exception occurs. Analyze why and where the bug occurs, what structure the input has to have, and propose and implement a fix for it. Please document which steps you did in order to identify and implement this bug.

Advanced: 
3) The test data set given contains nodes and edges. Please explain the time complexity of the given implementation in terms of nodes and edge.
